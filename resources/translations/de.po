#~ "                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ " Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n"
#~ " Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n"
#~ " of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "                            Preamble\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n"
#~ "software and other kinds of works.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n"
#~ "to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n"
#~ "the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n"
#~ "share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n"
#~ "software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n"
#~ "GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n"
#~ "any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n"
#~ "your programs, too.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n"
#~ "price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n"
#~ "have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n"
#~ "them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n"
#~ "want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n"
#~ "free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n"
#~ "these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n"
#~ "certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n"
#~ "you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n"
#~ "gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n"
#~ "freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n"
#~ "or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n"
#~ "know their rights.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n"
#~ "(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n"
#~ "giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n"
#~ "that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n"
#~ "authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n"
#~ "changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n"
#~ "authors of previous versions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n"
#~ "modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n"
#~ "can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n"
#~ "protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n"
#~ "pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n"
#~ "use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n"
#~ "have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n"
#~ "products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n"
#~ "stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n"
#~ "of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n"
#~ "States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n"
#~ "software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n"
#~ "avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n"
#~ "make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n"
#~ "patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n"
#~ "modification follow.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  0. Definitions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n"
#~ "works, such as semiconductor masks.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n"
#~ "License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n"
#~ "\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n"
#~ "in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n"
#~ "exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n"
#~ "earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n"
#~ "on the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n"
#~ "permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n"
#~ "infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n"
#~ "computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n"
#~ "distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n"
#~ "public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n"
#~ "parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n"
#~ "a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n"
#~ "to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n"
#~ "feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n"
#~ "tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n"
#~ "extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n"
#~ "work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n"
#~ "the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n"
#~ "menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  1. Source Code.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n"
#~ "for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n"
#~ "form of a work.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\n"
#~ "standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n"
#~ "interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n"
#~ "is widely used among developers working in that language.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\n"
#~ "than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n"
#~ "packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n"
#~ "Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n"
#~ "Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n"
#~ "implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n"
#~ "\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n"
#~ "(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n"
#~ "(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n"
#~ "produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n"
#~ "the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n"
#~ "work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n"
#~ "control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n"
#~ "System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n"
#~ "programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n"
#~ "which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n"
#~ "includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n"
#~ "the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n"
#~ "linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n"
#~ "such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n"
#~ "subprograms and other parts of the work.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n"
#~ "can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n"
#~ "Source.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n"
#~ "same work.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  2. Basic Permissions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n"
#~ "copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n"
#~ "conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n"
#~ "permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n"
#~ "covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n"
#~ "content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n"
#~ "rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n"
#~ "convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n"
#~ "in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n"
#~ "of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n"
#~ "with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n"
#~ "the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n"
#~ "not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n"
#~ "for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n"
#~ "and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n"
#~ "your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n"
#~ "the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n"
#~ "makes it unnecessary.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n"
#~ "measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n"
#~ "11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n"
#~ "similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n"
#~ "measures.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n"
#~ "circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n"
#~ "is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n"
#~ "the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n"
#~ "modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n"
#~ "users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n"
#~ "technological measures.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n"
#~ "receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n"
#~ "appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n"
#~ "keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n"
#~ "non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n"
#~ "keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n"
#~ "recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n"
#~ "and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n"
#~ "produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n"
#~ "terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n"
#~ "    it, and giving a relevant date.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n"
#~ "    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n"
#~ "    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n"
#~ "    \"keep intact all notices\".\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n"
#~ "    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n"
#~ "    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n"
#~ "    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n"
#~ "    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n"
#~ "    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n"
#~ "    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n"
#~ "    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n"
#~ "    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n"
#~ "    work need not make them do so.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n"
#~ "works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n"
#~ "and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n"
#~ "in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n"
#~ "\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n"
#~ "used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n"
#~ "beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n"
#~ "in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n"
#~ "parts of the aggregate.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n"
#~ "of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n"
#~ "machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n"
#~ "in one of these ways:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n"
#~ "    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n"
#~ "    customarily used for software interchange.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n"
#~ "    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n"
#~ "    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n"
#~ "    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n"
#~ "    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n"
#~ "    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n"
#~ "    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n"
#~ "    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n"
#~ "    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n"
#~ "    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n"
#~ "    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n"
#~ "    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n"
#~ "    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n"
#~ "    with subsection 6b.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n"
#~ "    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n"
#~ "    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n"
#~ "    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n"
#~ "    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n"
#~ "    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n"
#~ "    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n"
#~ "    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n"
#~ "    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n"
#~ "    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n"
#~ "    charge under subsection 6d.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n"
#~ "from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n"
#~ "included in conveying the object code work.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n"
#~ "tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n"
#~ "or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n"
#~ "into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n"
#~ "doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n"
#~ "product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\n"
#~ "typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n"
#~ "of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n"
#~ "actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n"
#~ "is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n"
#~ "commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n"
#~ "the only significant mode of use of the product.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\n"
#~ "procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n"
#~ "and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n"
#~ "a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n"
#~ "suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n"
#~ "code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n"
#~ "modification has been made.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n"
#~ "specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n"
#~ "part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n"
#~ "User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n"
#~ "fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n"
#~ "Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n"
#~ "by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n"
#~ "if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n"
#~ "modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n"
#~ "been installed in ROM).\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n"
#~ "requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n"
#~ "for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n"
#~ "the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n"
#~ "network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n"
#~ "adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n"
#~ "protocols for communication across the network.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n"
#~ "in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n"
#~ "documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n"
#~ "source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n"
#~ "unpacking, reading or copying.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  7. Additional Terms.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n"
#~ "License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n"
#~ "Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n"
#~ "be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n"
#~ "that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n"
#~ "apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n"
#~ "under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n"
#~ "this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n"
#~ "remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n"
#~ "it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n"
#~ "removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n"
#~ "additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n"
#~ "for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n"
#~ "add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n"
#~ "that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n"
#~ "    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n"
#~ "    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n"
#~ "    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n"
#~ "    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n"
#~ "    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n"
#~ "    authors of the material; or\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n"
#~ "    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n"
#~ "    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n"
#~ "    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n"
#~ "    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n"
#~ "    those licensors and authors.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n"
#~ "restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n"
#~ "received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n"
#~ "governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n"
#~ "restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n"
#~ "a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n"
#~ "License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n"
#~ "of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n"
#~ "not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n"
#~ "must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n"
#~ "additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n"
#~ "where to find the applicable terms.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n"
#~ "form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n"
#~ "the above requirements apply either way.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  8. Termination.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n"
#~ "provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n"
#~ "modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n"
#~ "this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n"
#~ "paragraph of section 11).\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n"
#~ "license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n"
#~ "provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n"
#~ "finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n"
#~ "holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n"
#~ "prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n"
#~ "reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n"
#~ "violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n"
#~ "received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n"
#~ "copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n"
#~ "your receipt of the notice.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n"
#~ "licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n"
#~ "this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n"
#~ "reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n"
#~ "material under section 10.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n"
#~ "run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n"
#~ "occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n"
#~ "to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n"
#~ "nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n"
#~ "modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n"
#~ "not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n"
#~ "covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n"
#~ "receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n"
#~ "propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n"
#~ "for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n"
#~ "organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n"
#~ "organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n"
#~ "work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n"
#~ "transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n"
#~ "licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n"
#~ "give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n"
#~ "Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n"
#~ "the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n"
#~ "rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n"
#~ "not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n"
#~ "rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n"
#~ "(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n"
#~ "any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n"
#~ "sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  11. Patents.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n"
#~ "License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n"
#~ "work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n"
#~ "owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n"
#~ "hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n"
#~ "by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n"
#~ "but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n"
#~ "consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n"
#~ "purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n"
#~ "patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n"
#~ "this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n"
#~ "patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n"
#~ "make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n"
#~ "propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n"
#~ "agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n"
#~ "(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n"
#~ "sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n"
#~ "party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n"
#~ "patent against the party.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n"
#~ "and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n"
#~ "to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n"
#~ "publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n"
#~ "then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n"
#~ "available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n"
#~ "patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n"
#~ "consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n"
#~ "license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n"
#~ "actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n"
#~ "covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n"
#~ "in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n"
#~ "country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n"
#~ "arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n"
#~ "covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n"
#~ "receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n"
#~ "or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n"
#~ "you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n"
#~ "work and works based on it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n"
#~ "the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n"
#~ "conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n"
#~ "specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n"
#~ "work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n"
#~ "in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n"
#~ "to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n"
#~ "the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n"
#~ "parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n"
#~ "patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n"
#~ "conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n"
#~ "for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n"
#~ "contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n"
#~ "or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n"
#~ "any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n"
#~ "otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n"
#~ "otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n"
#~ "excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n"
#~ "covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n"
#~ "License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n"
#~ "not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n"
#~ "to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n"
#~ "the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n"
#~ "License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n"
#~ "permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n"
#~ "under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n"
#~ "combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n"
#~ "License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n"
#~ "but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n"
#~ "section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n"
#~ "combination as such.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\n"
#~ "the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n"
#~ "be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n"
#~ "address new problems or concerns.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\n"
#~ "Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\n"
#~ "Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\n"
#~ "option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\n"
#~ "version or of any later version published by the Free Software\n"
#~ "Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\n"
#~ "GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\n"
#~ "by the Free Software Foundation.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\n"
#~ "versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\n"
#~ "public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\n"
#~ "to choose that version for the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Later license versions may give you additional or different\n"
#~ "permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\n"
#~ "author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\n"
#~ "later version.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\n"
#~ "APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\n"
#~ "HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\n"
#~ "OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\n"
#~ "THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n"
#~ "PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\n"
#~ "IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\n"
#~ "ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  16. Limitation of Liability.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n"
#~ "WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\n"
#~ "THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\n"
#~ "GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\n"
#~ "USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\n"
#~ "DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\n"
#~ "PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\n"
#~ "EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n"
#~ "SUCH DAMAGES.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\n"
#~ "above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\n"
#~ "reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\n"
#~ "an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\n"
#~ "Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\n"
#~ "copy of the Program in return for a fee.\n"

#~ "            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n"
#~ "possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n"
#~ "free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n"
#~ "to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n"
#~ "state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n"
#~ "the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n"

#~ "                            Preamble\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\n"
#~ "software and other kinds of works.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\n"
#~ "to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\n"
#~ "the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\n"
#~ "share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\n"
#~ "software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\n"
#~ "GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\n"
#~ "any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\n"
#~ "your programs, too.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n"
#~ "price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n"
#~ "have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n"
#~ "them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\n"
#~ "want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\n"
#~ "free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\n"
#~ "these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\n"
#~ "certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\n"
#~ "you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n"
#~ "gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\n"
#~ "freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\n"
#~ "or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\n"
#~ "know their rights.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n"
#~ "(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\n"
#~ "giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\n"
#~ "that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\n"
#~ "authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\n"
#~ "changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\n"
#~ "authors of previous versions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\n"
#~ "modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\n"
#~ "can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\n"
#~ "protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\n"
#~ "pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\n"
#~ "use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\n"
#~ "have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\n"
#~ "products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\n"
#~ "stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\n"
#~ "of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\n"
#~ "States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\n"
#~ "software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\n"
#~ "avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\n"
#~ "make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\n"
#~ "patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n"
#~ "modification follow.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  0. Definitions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\n"
#~ "works, such as semiconductor masks.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\n"
#~ "License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n"
#~ "\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\n"
#~ "in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\n"
#~ "exact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\n"
#~ "earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\n"
#~ "on the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\n"
#~ "permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\n"
#~ "infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\n"
#~ "computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\n"
#~ "distribution (with or without modification), making available to the\n"
#~ "public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\n"
#~ "parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\n"
#~ "a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\n"
#~ "to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\n"
#~ "feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\n"
#~ "tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\n"
#~ "extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\n"
#~ "work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\n"
#~ "the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\n"
#~ "menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  1. Source Code.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\n"
#~ "for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\n"
#~ "form of a work.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\n"
#~ "standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\n"
#~ "interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\n"
#~ "is widely used among developers working in that language.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\n"
#~ "than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\n"
#~ "packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\n"
#~ "Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\n"
#~ "Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\n"
#~ "implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n"
#~ "\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n"
#~ "(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n"
#~ "(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\n"
#~ "produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\n"
#~ "the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\n"
#~ "work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\n"
#~ "control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\n"
#~ "System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\n"
#~ "programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\n"
#~ "which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\n"
#~ "includes interface definition files associated with source files for\n"
#~ "the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\n"
#~ "linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\n"
#~ "such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\n"
#~ "subprograms and other parts of the work.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\n"
#~ "can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\n"
#~ "Source.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\n"
#~ "same work.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  2. Basic Permissions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\n"
#~ "copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\n"
#~ "conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\n"
#~ "permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\n"
#~ "covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\n"
#~ "content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\n"
#~ "rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\n"
#~ "convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\n"
#~ "in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\n"
#~ "of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\n"
#~ "with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\n"
#~ "the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\n"
#~ "not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\n"
#~ "for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\n"
#~ "and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\n"
#~ "your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\n"
#~ "the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\n"
#~ "makes it unnecessary.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\n"
#~ "measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n"
#~ "11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\n"
#~ "similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\n"
#~ "measures.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\n"
#~ "circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\n"
#~ "is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\n"
#~ "the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\n"
#~ "modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\n"
#~ "users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\n"
#~ "technological measures.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\n"
#~ "receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n"
#~ "appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\n"
#~ "keep intact all notices stating that this License and any\n"
#~ "non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\n"
#~ "keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\n"
#~ "recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\n"
#~ "and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\n"
#~ "produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\n"
#~ "terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n"
#~ "    it, and giving a relevant date.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n"
#~ "    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n"
#~ "    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n"
#~ "    \"keep intact all notices\".\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n"
#~ "    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n"
#~ "    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n"
#~ "    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n"
#~ "    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n"
#~ "    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n"
#~ "    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n"
#~ "    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n"
#~ "    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n"
#~ "    work need not make them do so.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\n"
#~ "works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\n"
#~ "and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\n"
#~ "in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n"
#~ "\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\n"
#~ "used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\n"
#~ "beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\n"
#~ "in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\n"
#~ "parts of the aggregate.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\n"
#~ "of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\n"
#~ "machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\n"
#~ "in one of these ways:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n"
#~ "    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n"
#~ "    customarily used for software interchange.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n"
#~ "    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n"
#~ "    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n"
#~ "    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n"
#~ "    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n"
#~ "    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n"
#~ "    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n"
#~ "    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n"
#~ "    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n"
#~ "    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n"
#~ "    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n"
#~ "    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n"
#~ "    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n"
#~ "    with subsection 6b.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n"
#~ "    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n"
#~ "    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n"
#~ "    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n"
#~ "    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n"
#~ "    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n"
#~ "    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n"
#~ "    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n"
#~ "    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n"
#~ "    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n"
#~ "    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n"
#~ "    charge under subsection 6d.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\n"
#~ "from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\n"
#~ "included in conveying the object code work.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\n"
#~ "tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\n"
#~ "or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\n"
#~ "into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\n"
#~ "doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\n"
#~ "product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\n"
#~ "typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\n"
#~ "of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\n"
#~ "actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\n"
#~ "is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\n"
#~ "commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\n"
#~ "the only significant mode of use of the product.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\n"
#~ "procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\n"
#~ "and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\n"
#~ "a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\n"
#~ "suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\n"
#~ "code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\n"
#~ "modification has been made.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\n"
#~ "specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\n"
#~ "part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\n"
#~ "User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\n"
#~ "fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\n"
#~ "Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\n"
#~ "by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\n"
#~ "if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\n"
#~ "modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\n"
#~ "been installed in ROM).\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\n"
#~ "requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\n"
#~ "for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\n"
#~ "the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\n"
#~ "network may be denied when the modification itself materially and\n"
#~ "adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\n"
#~ "protocols for communication across the network.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\n"
#~ "in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\n"
#~ "documented (and with an implementation available to the public in\n"
#~ "source code form), and must require no special password or key for\n"
#~ "unpacking, reading or copying.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  7. Additional Terms.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\n"
#~ "License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\n"
#~ "Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\n"
#~ "be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\n"
#~ "that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\n"
#~ "apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\n"
#~ "under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\n"
#~ "this License without regard to the additional permissions.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\n"
#~ "remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\n"
#~ "it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\n"
#~ "removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\n"
#~ "additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\n"
#~ "for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\n"
#~ "add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\n"
#~ "that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n"
#~ "    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n"
#~ "    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n"
#~ "    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n"
#~ "    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n"
#~ "    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n"
#~ "    authors of the material; or\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n"
#~ "    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n"
#~ "    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n"
#~ "    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n"
#~ "    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n"
#~ "    those licensors and authors.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\n"
#~ "restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\n"
#~ "received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\n"
#~ "governed by this License along with a term that is a further\n"
#~ "restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\n"
#~ "a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\n"
#~ "License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\n"
#~ "of that license document, provided that the further restriction does\n"
#~ "not survive such relicensing or conveying.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\n"
#~ "must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\n"
#~ "additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\n"
#~ "where to find the applicable terms.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\n"
#~ "form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\n"
#~ "the above requirements apply either way.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  8. Termination.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\n"
#~ "provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\n"
#~ "modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\n"
#~ "this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\n"
#~ "paragraph of section 11).\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\n"
#~ "license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\n"
#~ "provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\n"
#~ "finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\n"
#~ "holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\n"
#~ "prior to 60 days after the cessation.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\n"
#~ "reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\n"
#~ "violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\n"
#~ "received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\n"
#~ "copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\n"
#~ "your receipt of the notice.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\n"
#~ "licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\n"
#~ "this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\n"
#~ "reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\n"
#~ "material under section 10.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\n"
#~ "run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\n"
#~ "occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\n"
#~ "to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\n"
#~ "nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\n"
#~ "modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\n"
#~ "not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\n"
#~ "covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\n"
#~ "receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\n"
#~ "propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\n"
#~ "for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\n"
#~ "organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\n"
#~ "organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\n"
#~ "work results from an entity transaction, each party to that\n"
#~ "transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\n"
#~ "licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\n"
#~ "give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\n"
#~ "Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\n"
#~ "the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\n"
#~ "rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\n"
#~ "not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\n"
#~ "rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n"
#~ "(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\n"
#~ "any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\n"
#~ "sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  11. Patents.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\n"
#~ "License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\n"
#~ "work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\n"
#~ "owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\n"
#~ "hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\n"
#~ "by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\n"
#~ "but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\n"
#~ "consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\n"
#~ "purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\n"
#~ "patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\n"
#~ "this License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\n"
#~ "patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\n"
#~ "make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\n"
#~ "propagate the contents of its contributor version.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\n"
#~ "agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n"
#~ "(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\n"
#~ "sue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\n"
#~ "party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\n"
#~ "patent against the party.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\n"
#~ "and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\n"
#~ "to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\n"
#~ "publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\n"
#~ "then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\n"
#~ "available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\n"
#~ "patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\n"
#~ "consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\n"
#~ "license to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\n"
#~ "actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\n"
#~ "covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\n"
#~ "in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\n"
#~ "country that you have reason to believe are valid.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\n"
#~ "arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\n"
#~ "covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\n"
#~ "receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\n"
#~ "or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\n"
#~ "you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\n"
#~ "work and works based on it.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\n"
#~ "the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\n"
#~ "conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\n"
#~ "specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\n"
#~ "work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\n"
#~ "in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\n"
#~ "to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\n"
#~ "the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\n"
#~ "parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\n"
#~ "patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\n"
#~ "conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\n"
#~ "for and in connection with specific products or compilations that\n"
#~ "contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\n"
#~ "or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\n"
#~ "any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\n"
#~ "otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n"
#~ "otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n"
#~ "excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\n"
#~ "covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n"
#~ "License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\n"
#~ "not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\n"
#~ "to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\n"
#~ "the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\n"
#~ "License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n"
#~ "\n"
#~ "  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\n"
#~ "permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\n"
#~ "under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\n"
#~ "combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\n"
#~ "License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\n"
#~ "but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\n"
#~ "section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\n"
#~ "combination as such.\n"
